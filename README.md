# Tentative results of the VNN-COMP 2024

These are the tentative results of the VNN-COMP 2024. Please check the results for your tool to make sure everything was evaluated correctly!

The results are summarized in the two files `SCORING/latex/results_regular_track.pdf` and `SCORING/latex/results_extended_track.pdf`. You can generate those files yourself by running the `SCORING/run.py` script. Please install all pip requirements first (see `SCORING/requirements.txt`).
You can switch between the regular and extended track by changing line 57 of the `SCORING/settings.py` file.

If you identify any issues, please get in touch with the organizers so we can fix them.
